# CDDP
constraint differential dynamical programming. 

Code for the paper Differential Dynamic Programming with Nonlinear Constraints, Zhaoming Xie, C. Karen Liu, and Kris Hauser, in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2017: https://zhaomingxie.github.io/publications/CDDP.pdf.

use OSQP (https://osqp.org/docs/index.html) as QP solver

contains example for a double integrator and a 2D car with circular constraint
